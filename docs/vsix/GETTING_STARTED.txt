SLNX Mermaid – Getting Started

## Overview

SLNX Mermaid generates Mermaid diagrams from Visual Studio solution files (.sln / .slnx).
It helps visualize project dependencies and architecture directly inside Visual Studio.

## Installation

1. Install the extension from the Visual Studio Marketplace.
2. Restart Visual Studio if required.

## How to Use

1. Open a solution (.sln or .slnx).
2. Right-click the solution node in Solution Explorer.
3. Select the SLNX Mermaid command.
4. The diagram file will be generated.
5. Open the generated file in a Mermaid-compatible viewer or Markdown preview.

## Configuration

If a configuration file is supported:

* Place the configuration file in the solution directory.
* Adjust filtering or output options as needed.

## Output

The extension generates a Mermaid diagram file describing:

* Project references
* Dependency relationships
* Structural overview

## Troubleshooting

* Ensure the solution builds successfully.
* Ensure project references are valid.
* Check the Output window for extension logs.
